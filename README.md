Geospatial Data Visualization Web Application
This full-stack web application was built using Python (Flask) and SQLite, integrating advanced geospatial data visualization features for interactive data analysis and mapping. The system supports dynamic CRUD operations, spatial data rendering, and embedded analytics through visual charts and maps.

Key Features
Complete CRUD: Create, edit, view, and delete geospatial records using Flask routes and SQLite.
Interactive Maps: Leaflet.js integration with multiple base layers including OpenStreetMap, Satellite, Topographic, and Dark modes.
GeoJSON Visualization: Display points, lines, and polygons with customized popups and thematic styling.
Real-Time Markers: Fetch markers from Flask endpoints dynamically and render them using custom icons.
Live Mouse Coordinates: Show coordinates in real time on the map interface.
Basemap Toggling: Enable users to switch between basemap styles with built-in Leaflet layer controls.
Analytics Dashboards: Plotly charts including bar and stacked bar charts rendered in Jinja2 templates for interactive data visualization.
Technology Stack
Python (Flask), SQLite for lightweight database management, Leaflet.js for geospatial interactivity, Plotly for data visualization, and HTML/CSS/Bootstrap for responsive UI.

Example Use Cases
Visualizing cities such as Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Murree, and New York using interactive markers
Displaying live GeoJSON datasets for spatial data analysis
Providing in-app map tools and dashboard-level analytics for location-based decision-making
This project demonstrates expertise in geospatial integration, RESTful architecture, client-side rendering, and full-stack development using Python and modern web technologies.
